# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

# Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

# Insight
The problem requires us to construct a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversals. A binary tree's preorder traversal visits the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. The inorder traversal visits the left subtree first, then the root, and finally the right subtree.

This problem is common in computer science and software engineering interviews, as it tests the candidate's understanding of tree data structures and tree traversal algorithms.

# Understanding and Analysis
When we look at the preorder traversal, we notice that the root of the tree is always the first element. After that, comes the elements of the left subtree and then the elements of the right subtree.

On the other hand, in the inorder traversal, the elements of the left subtree come first, then the root, and finally the elements of the right subtree.

We can use these properties to divide the original problem into smaller subproblems. By finding the root in the inorder traversal, we can divide the inorder array into two subarrays: one for the left subtree and one for the right subtree. We can do the same with the preorder array.

This approach lends itself to a recursive solution: we create the root, build the left subtree, and then build the right subtree.

preorder: [x, (..., left, ...), (..., right, ...)]

inorder:  [(..., left, ...), x, (..., right, ...)]

# Solution
Here's a Python solution for this problem:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not preorder: return None

        root_val = preorder[0]
        root = TreeNode(val=root_val)

        inorder_root_index = inorder.index(root_val)

        # divide into left and right subarrays
        inorder_left = inorder[:inorder_root_index]
        inorder_right = inorder[inorder_root_index+1:]

        preorder_left = preorder[1:1+inorder_root_index]  # Using inorder_root_index directly to slice preorder
        preorder_right = preorder[1+inorder_root_index:]

        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder_left, inorder_left)
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder_right, inorder_right)
        
        return root

```
# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because for each node, we perform an operation that can take up to O(n) time (finding the root in the inorder array), and we do this for all n nodes.

The space complexity is O(n), which comes from the space used by the recursive call stack (in the worst case, if the tree is skewed, we could end up with n nested calls), as well as the space used to store the output (the constructed binary tree).

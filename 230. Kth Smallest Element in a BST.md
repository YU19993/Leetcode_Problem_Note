# Blog: Solving the Kth Smallest Element in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement:

Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer `k`, return the `kth` smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

## Understanding the Problem:

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where for each node, the values of the left child node are less than the value of the node, and the values of the right child node are greater than the value of the node. This property ensures that an in-order traversal of the BST results in a list of node values sorted in ascending order. The problem is asking for the `kth` smallest element of all node values. We can solve this problem by performing an in-order traversal on the tree and returning the `kth` element.

## Solution Approach:

We will demonstrate two solutions to this problem: the recursive approach and the iterative approach. 

### 1. Recursive Approach:

This approach uses recursion to traverse the tree in in-order fashion, which generates a list of nodes in ascending order. Then, it simply returns the `kth` smallest node.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        # This function performs an in-order traversal of the tree.
        def inOrder(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            
            return inOrder(node.left) + [node.val] + inOrder(node.right)

        # This generates the list of nodes in ascending order.
        nodes_in_order = inOrder(root)
        
        # Then simply return the kth smallest node.
        return nodes_in_order[k-1]
```

### 2. Iterative Approach (Without Recursion):

In some cases, recursion might be costly due to function call overheads. In these scenarios, an iterative approach is preferred. This approach maintains a stack of nodes and traverses the tree iteratively in in-order fashion. 

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack with the root node and a counter variable.
        nodes, count = [root], 0
        
        # Use a while loop to process the nodes in the stack.
        while nodes:
            node = nodes[0]
            
            # If the node has a left child, add it to the stack and remove its link from the node.
            if node.left:
                nodes.insert(0, node.left)
                node.left = None
            else:
                # If the node does not have a left child, it means that it is the next node in the in-order traversal.
                # So, increase the counter and remove the node from the stack.
                count += 1
                nodes.pop(0)
                
                # If the counter equals k, it means that we have found the kth smallest element.
                if count == k:
                    return node.val
                
                # If the node has a right child, add it to the stack.
                if node.right:
                    nodes.insert(0, node.right)
```

Both the recursive and iterative approaches provide the correct solution, but the choice between them depends on the specific problem context. The recursive approach has simpler and more intuitive code, but it might not be efficient for large trees due to its space complexity. On the other hand, the iterative approach is more efficient in terms of space complexity, but the code is more complex.

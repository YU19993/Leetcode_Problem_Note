Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Splitting the Versions:** We'll start by splitting both version strings by '.' to get the individual revisions.

2. **Comparing Revisions:** We'll compare the revisions of the two versions from left to right. Since one version may have more revisions than the other, we'll iterate up to the maximum number of revisions between the two versions. If a version doesn't have a revision at a particular index, we'll treat it as 0.

3. **Handling Leading Zeros:** We can convert the revision strings to integers, which will automatically handle the leading zeros.

4. **Returning the Result:** As we iterate and compare, if we find a revision in version1 that's greater than the corresponding revision in version2, we'll return 1. If it's less, we'll return -1. If we finish iterating without returning, the versions are equal, and we'll return 0.

Here's the Python code that implements the above solution:

```python
def compareVersion(version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
    # Split the versions by '.' to get the revisions
    v1_revisions = version1.split('.')
    v2_revisions = version2.split('.')
    
    # Get the maximum number of revisions between the two versions
    max_length = max(len(v1_revisions), len(v2_revisions))
    
    for i in range(max_length):
        # Get the revision at the current index for both versions. If a revision doesn't exist, treat it as 0
        v1_revision = int(v1_revisions[i]) if i < len(v1_revisions) else 0
        v2_revision = int(v2_revisions[i]) if i < len(v2_revisions) else 0
        
        # Compare the revisions
        if v1_revision > v2_revision:
            return 1
        elif v1_revision < v2_revision:
            return -1

    # If we reach here, the versions are equal
    return 0
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(compareVersion("1.01", "1.001"))  # Expected output: 0
print(compareVersion("1.0", "1.0.0"))   # Expected output: 0
print(compareVersion("0.1", "1.1"))     # Expected output: -1
```

This solution should work for all valid version numbers as per the provided constraints.
